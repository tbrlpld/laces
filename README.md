## Contributing

### Install

To make changes to this project, first clone this repository:

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/tbrlpld/laces.git
$ cd laces
```

With your preferred virtualenv activated, install testing dependencies:

#### Using pip

```sh
$ python -m pip install --upgrade pip>=21.3
$ python -m pip install -e '.[testing]' -U
```

#### Using flit

```sh
$ python -m pip install flit
$ flit install
```

### pre-commit

Note that this project uses [pre-commit](https://github.com/pre-commit/pre-commit).
It is included in the project testing requirements. To set up locally:

```shell
# go to the project directory
$ cd laces
# initialize pre-commit
$ pre-commit install

# Optional, run all checks once for this, then the checks will run only on the changed files
$ git ls-files --others --cached --exclude-standard | xargs pre-commit run --files
```

### How to run tests

Now you can run all tests like so:

```sh
$ tox
```

Or, you can run them for a specific environment:

```sh
$ tox -e python3.11-django4.2-wagtail5.1
```

Or, run only a specific test:

```sh
$ tox -e python3.11-django4.2-wagtail5.1-sqlite laces.tests.test_file.TestClass.test_method
```

To run the test app interactively, use:

```sh
$ tox -e interactive
```

You can now visit `http://localhost:8020/`.

### Python version management

Tox will attempt to find installed Python versions on your machine.
If you use `pyenv` to manage multiple versions, you can tell `tox` to use those versions.
This working, is depended on [`virtualenv-pyenv`](https://pypi.org/project/virtualenv-pyenv/) (note: this is not `pyenv-virtualenv`) which is part of the CI dependencies (just like `tox` itself is).
To enable the use, you want to set the environment variable `VIRTUALENV_DISCOVERY=pyenv`.
